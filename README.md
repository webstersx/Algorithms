# Algorithms
A Swift 2.0 implementation of Algorithms described in [Algorithms 4th Edition (R. Sedgewick &amp; K. Wayne)](http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/)

A rough idea of what will be implemented (or build upon other data structures):

### Sort
- Selection sort
- Insertion sort
- Shellsort
- Mergesort
- Quicksort
- 3-way Quicksort
- Heapsort

### Search
- Sequential search (unordered)
- Binary search (ordered arrays, binary tree)
- TBC.


These Algorithms will be built upon Data Structures defined in the sister-repository: [Data Structures](https://github.com/webstersx/DataStructures)
